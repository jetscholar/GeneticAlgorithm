### Notes

Generation 0 - random

fitness function

single point crossover function

eltism - preserve good gene sets

mutations - change random gene

1. genetic representation of a solution - starting generation
2. a function to generate new solutions
3. fitness function - checks for highest fitness for pairing
4. selection function - selects solution for next generation
5. crossover function - crosses part of the genome between fit parents
6. mutation function - random value inserted in genome
